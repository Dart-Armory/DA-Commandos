## Dart's Armory - Commando Squads
[Dart's Armory](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2954171067) is a group of mods all created by [DartRuffian](https://github.com/DartRuffian), which adds many re-textured items from several mods for the game ARMA 3.

**Description**

It originally started as a small mod for one Commando Squad, but I decided to possibly expand it to other squads. This may expand even further than just Commando Squads, but will primarily be Special Forces units. With this change came a rewrite to better organize the mod in the case of multiple squads.

Each Commando Squad features a Squad Leader, Explosives Specialist, Squad Medic, and Designated Marksman; this is slightly altered from how Commando Squads are organized in canon, as there is no medic, but this is simply a gameplay change for Arma.

These armors in this mod are all used by real people for a custom campaign run by someone in the [104th Wolfpack Battalion](https://discord.gg/DF4eEDZNrW) (this is a campaign run seperate from our unit, we do not have Commandos in our unit itself); the only exception being the Imperial Commando armor, as that was a side project I decided to include in the mod.
